- Instant refund mechanisms
- Transparent transaction history

### 2. NFT Property Representation
- Each rental property minted as a unique NFT
- Immutable property details and ownership records
- Fractional property ownership capabilities
- Tradable and transferable property tokens
- Verifiable property authenticity

### 3. Comprehensive Reputation System
#### Host Reputation Management
- On-chain reputation scoring
- Transparent review mechanism
- Performance-based ranking
- Stake-based quality assurance
- Incentives for exceptional service

#### Guest Reputation Tracking
- Verified booking and interaction history
- Trust score calculation
- Penalty mechanisms for property damages
- Reputation-based booking privileges
- Behavioral incentive framework

### 4. IoT Device Integration
- Blockchain-verified smart locks
- Keyless entry authentication
- Real-time energy consumption monitoring
- Automated utility billing
- Security system integration
- Remote property management

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- Blockchain: Ethereum/Polygon
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: IPFS, The Graph
- IoT Protocol: MQTT, Chainlink Oracles

### System Workflow
1. Property NFT Creation
2. Listing Registration
3. Smart Contract Booking
4. IoT Device Verification
5. Automated Check-in/Check-out
6. Reputation Update
7. Payment Settlement

## Smart Contract Modules

### Key Contracts
- `PropertyRegistry.sol`: NFT property management
- `BookingEscrow.sol`: Secure payment handling
- `ReputationScore.sol`: Host and guest trust mechanism
- `IoTVerification.sol`: Device authentication
- `DisputeResolution.sol`: Conflict mediation

### Booking Data Structure
```javascript
struct RentalBooking {
  propertyId: string;
  renter: address;
  host: address;
  checkInDate: uint256;
  checkOutDate: uint256;
  totalPrice: uint256;
  status: BookingStatus;
  securityDeposit: uint256;
}

enum BookingStatus {
  PENDING,
  CONFIRMED,
  CHECKED_IN,
  CHECKED_OUT,
  COMPLETED,
  CANCELLED
}
```
